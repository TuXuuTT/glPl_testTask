mvn clean test -Duser.login=\<loginName\> -Duser.password=\<loginPassword\>s

Chrome is used as default browser. If you want to run in Firefox, just add to command line:

-DbrowserClient=ff

There are only 1 positive test. In case of providing invalid credentials test will fail. For testing negative scenario there should be another test method
